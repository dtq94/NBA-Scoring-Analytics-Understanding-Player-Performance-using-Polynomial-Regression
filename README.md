# Overview
This project aims to predict the points scored by NBA teams using polynomial regression. By analyzing various attributes such as team name, average number of weightlifting sessions, average number of yoga sessions, average number of laps run per practice, water intake, and number of players absent for sessions, we seek to uncover patterns and trends that contribute to a team's scoring performance.

# Objectives
- Predict points scored by NBA teams based on team attributes.
- Identify key factors influencing team scoring performance.
- Provide insights to coaches, team managers, and owners for informed decision-making.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following attributes:

- Team name
- Points scored
- Average number of weightlifting sessions
- Average number of yoga sessions
- Average number of laps run per practice
- Water intake
- Number of players absent for sessions

# Methodology
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory data analysis: Analyzing relationships between attributes and points scored.
Model selection: Choosing polynomial regression for predicting team scores.
- Model training: Fitting the regression model to the data.
- Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model.
- Insights and interpretation: Interpreting model coefficients and providing actionable insights.

Results
The trained polynomial regression model achieved an accuracy of X%. Key factors influencing team scoring performance include weightlifting sessions, yoga sessions, laps run per practice, and player attendance.

Conclusion
Accurately predicting the points scored by NBA teams can provide valuable insights for coaches, team managers, and owners. By understanding the factors that contribute to scoring performance, teams can make informed decisions to improve their overall performance and success in the league.
